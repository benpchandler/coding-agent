Create a PDF financial statement extraction service that can: 1. Accept PDF files containing financial statements (income statements, balance sheets, cash flow statements) 2. Extract text and tables using PyMuPDF 3. Identify the type of statement (income, balance sheet, or cash flow) 4. Detect and extract period information (year/month) 5. Convert extracted data into a structured JSON format with standardized line item names 6. Handle various PDF layouts and formats from common accounting software 7. Implement proper error handling for malformed or unsupported documents. This service should be implemented as a Python module that can be called from FastAPI endpoints, with clear interfaces for processing uploaded files.
